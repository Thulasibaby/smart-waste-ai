# Smart Waste AI

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify waste into different categories like plastic, metal, paper, and organic.

## Features
- Waste image classification using deep learning
- Trained on waste image datasets
- Easy to use for smart bin automation or recycling systems

## Files
- `waste_classifier_cnn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for model training and evaluation
- `predict.py`: Script to test model on new images
- `model.h5`: Trained CNN model (not included in this demo)
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open and run `waste_classifier_cnn.ipynb` for training or testing
3. Use `predict.py` to make predictions on new waste images
